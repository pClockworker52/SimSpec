# SimSpec Icon Generation Prompts

## üé® Main App Icon / Logo

```
Create a modern, professional app icon for "SimSpec" - an AI-powered engineering analysis mobile app. 

Style: Clean, technical, modern flat design with subtle gradients
Colors: Deep engineering blue (#1E3A8A) with bright accent green (#10B981) 
Size: 1024x1024px, suitable for Android app stores

Icon Elements:
- Central focus: Stylized smartphone camera viewfinder overlaying a mechanical gear or engineering component
- AI element: Subtle circuit pattern or neural network lines integrated into the design
- Engineering context: Small technical elements like bolt patterns, stress analysis lines, or CAE mesh patterns as background texture
- Typography: "SS" monogram in clean, technical font (optional secondary version)

The icon should convey:
- Mobile technology (camera/phone)
- Engineering precision (gears, technical elements) 
- AI intelligence (circuit patterns, analysis lines)
- Professional reliability (clean, corporate-ready design)

Avoid: Overly complex details, cartoon style, consumer product aesthetics
Target feeling: "Tesla meets AutoCAD meets mobile innovation"
```

## üîß Feature Icons

### Analysis Stage Icons
```
Create 3 minimalist icons representing SimSpec's analysis stages:

Stage 1 - Technical Decomposition:
- Simple line art of a mechanical component being "exploded" or separated into parts
- Clean engineering blueprint style, white lines on colored background
- 48x48dp, Material Design 3 compatible

Stage 2 - Failure Analysis: 
- Stylized magnifying glass over technical stress lines or crack patterns
- Emphasis on inspection and detailed analysis
- Same style and size as Stage 1

Stage 3 - Simulation Strategy:
- Abstract representation of simulation mesh or FEA analysis visualization
- Could be a 3D wireframe object with stress color gradients
- Consistent with other stage icons

Colors: Use app's primary blue with green accents
Style: Minimal, technical line art suitable for mobile UI
```

### Camera Flow Icons
```
Create icons for the 3-photo capture workflow:

Photo 1 Icon - "Overview":
- Camera viewfinder with wide-angle indicator lines
- Component silhouette in center showing full object view
- 24x24dp, simple line art

Photo 2 Icon - "Connections":
- Camera focused on joint/connection detail
- Zoom lines converging on bolted or welded joint
- Shows close-up inspection concept

Photo 3 Icon - "Problem Areas":  
- Camera with attention/warning indicator
- Small stress concentration or crack lines visible
- Suggests detailed problem area inspection

Style: Consistent line weight, technical illustration feel
Usage: UI buttons and workflow guidance
```

## üìã Report Generation Icons

```
Create professional icons for SimSpec's output features:

Export Report Icon:
- Document icon with technical drawing elements (grid lines, dimensions)
- Small engineering symbols (√ò for diameter, stress arrows)
- Subtle "share" arrow indicating export capability
- 32x32dp, suitable for FAB button

Share Analysis Icon:
- Traditional share icon enhanced with engineering context
- Network nodes connecting to represent collaboration
- Technical document in the sharing flow
- Material Design 3 share pattern adapted for engineering

Simulation Request Icon:
- Stylized FEA mesh or simulation visualization
- Clean, professional representation of CAE analysis
- Could include stress color gradient (blue to red)
- Conveys "simulation ready" concept
```

## üéØ Specialized Technical Icons

```
Create unique icons representing engineering analysis types:

Structural Analysis Icon:
- Simplified I-beam or structural element with force arrows
- Clean, engineering drawing style
- Shows load application and reaction

Fatigue Analysis Icon:
- Component with cyclic loading arrows (circular/curved arrows)
- Subtle crack line indicating failure progression
- Technical yet understandable representation

Thermal Analysis Icon:
- Component silhouette with heat flow lines or temperature gradient
- Avoid typical "fire" symbols, keep technical
- Could use color gradient from blue (cool) to red (hot)

Vibration Analysis Icon:
- Component with oscillation/wave lines
- Frequency visualization without being too abstract
- Technical sine wave pattern or resonance indicators

Style Guidelines:
- Monoline or minimal filled style
- Engineering blueprint aesthetic
- Professional enough for B2B software
- Scalable from 16px to 256px
- Color: Primary blue with accent green highlights
```

## üåü Brand Identity Elements

```
Create supporting brand graphics for SimSpec:

Loading Animation Icon:
- Rotating gear or component being analyzed
- Scanning lines moving across technical drawing
- AI "thinking" visualization with clean, technical aesthetic
- Should convey "AI processing engineering data"

Success/Complete Icon:
- Engineering checkmark integrated with gear or technical element
- Green accent color, professional validation symbol
- Could include subtle FEA mesh or technical grid pattern

Error/Retry Icon:
- Clean, non-alarming technical refresh symbol
- Engineering-focused rather than generic retry arrow
- Maintains professional, technical brand voice

Background Patterns:
- Subtle technical grid or blueprint paper texture
- Light engineering drawing elements (dimension lines, symbols)
- CAE mesh patterns for advanced UI backgrounds
- Clean, minimal - suitable for app backgrounds
```

## üìê Design System Notes

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: Deep Engineering Blue (#1E3A8A)
- Accent: Technical Green (#10B981)  
- Supporting: Clean Gray (#6B7280)
- Background: Off-white (#F9FAFB)

**Style Consistency:**
- All icons should work in both light and dark themes
- Maintain 2-3px stroke weight for line art
- Use 8dp spacing grid for positioning
- Ensure WCAG AAA color contrast compliance

**File Formats Needed:**
- SVG for scalability
- PNG at 1x, 2x, 3x densities for Android
- ICO format for Windows compatibility (if needed)

**Testing Requirements:**
- Verify legibility at 16px minimum size
- Test on both light and dark backgrounds  
- Ensure icons remain recognizable when desaturated (accessibility)

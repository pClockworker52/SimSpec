# 🏆 SimSpec - Hackathon Submission

**🤖 Model Used**: LFM2-VL-1.6B Vision-Language Model  
**📱 Platform**: Android (API 31+)  
**⚡ Processing**: 100% Edge AI - No Cloud Required  

## What is SimSpec?

SimSpec is the **first mobile app** that transforms photos of mechanical components into professional CAE (Computer-Aided Engineering) simulation requests. Point your phone at any mechanical part, take 3 photos, and get a detailed engineering analysis report ready for simulation teams.

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

**Before SimSpec**: Engineers see a component in the field → manually write analysis requirements → send to CAE team → back-and-forth clarification → weeks of delay

**With SimSpec**: Photo → AI Analysis → Professional Report → Ready for Simulation → Minutes instead of weeks

## 🚀 Key Innovation

**We're the first to combine**:
- 📸 **Mobile Vision AI** with **CAE Engineering Expertise**
- 🧠 **LFM2-VL-1.6B** running entirely **on-device**  
- 📋 **Professional simulation scoping reports** in **industry-standard format**
- ⚡ **Field-ready workflow** for **working engineers**

## 🔥 Live Demo Highlights

**Input**: 3 photos of an office chair  
**AI Analysis**: 
- Identifies pneumatic cylinder, welded base, stress concentrations
- Maps load paths from user → seat → cylinder → base  
- Recommends fatigue analysis for base welds, BIFMA compliance testing

**Output**: Professional simulation scoping report with business justification, technical specifications, and complexity estimates

## 🎨 Technical Excellence

- **3-Stage Analysis Pipeline**: Technical Decomposition → Failure Mode Analysis → Simulation Strategy
- **Smart Engineering Context**: Distinguishes consumer products from critical infrastructure  
- **Professional Templates**: Industry-ready reports with ROI justification
- **Edge Processing**: 1.6B parameter model running smoothly on Android
- **Modern Architecture**: Jetpack Compose, CameraX, Clean Architecture

## 💡 Business Impact

**Target Users**: CAE Engineers, Design Engineers, Field Service Teams  
**Market Size**: $8B+ CAE simulation market  
**Value Prop**: Transform weeks of manual scoping into minutes of AI-powered analysis  

**Real ROI**: A single prevented prototype failure pays for years of SimSpec usage

## 🌟 Why This Matters

Engineering simulation is critical for:
- ✈️ **Aerospace**: Preventing catastrophic failures  
- 🏗️ **Civil**: Ensuring structural safety
- 🚗 **Automotive**: Optimizing performance and safety
- 🏭 **Industrial**: Reducing maintenance costs

**SimSpec democratizes access** to professional simulation scoping, bringing AI-powered analysis to any engineer with a smartphone.
